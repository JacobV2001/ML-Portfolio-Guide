# Machine Learning

## Supervised Learning

| Project Link | Algorithm | Tools | Project Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Endgame Image Classifier](https://github.com/JacobV2001/Avengers-EndGame-Image-Classification) | SVM (Support Vector Machine) | OpenCV, scikit-learn, Selenium, Flask, Data Scrapping | A machine learning classifier that identifies Avengers: Endgame characters based on facial features using a Support Vector Machine. The project includes facial feature extraction with OpenCV and a local web interface for user interaction. |
| [CAR PRICE PREDICTOR](https://github.com/JacobV2001/Car_Prices_Predictor) | Linear Regression | Pandas, Flask, scikit-learn, Data Preprocessing | A machine learning-powered web application that predicts car prices based on features such as make, model, mileage, and condition. Built with Flask, the app achieves 99% accuracy using linear regression to predict car prices. |
