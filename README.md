# Machine Learning

## Supervised Learning

| Project Link | Algorithm | Tools | Project Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| üé¨ [Endgame Image Classifier](https://github.com/JacobV2001/Avengers-EndGame-Image-Classification) | SVM (Support Vector Machine) | OpenCV, scikit-learn, Selenium, Flask, Data Scrapping | A machine learning classifier that identifies Avengers: Endgame characters based on facial features using a Support Vector Machine. The project includes facial feature extraction with OpenCV and a local web interface for user interaction. |
| üöó [Car Price Predictor](https://github.com/JacobV2001/Car_Prices_Predictor) | Linear Regression | Pandas, Flask, scikit-learn, Data Preprocessing | A machine learning-powered web application that predicts car prices based on features such as make, model, mileage, and condition. Built with Flask, the app achieves 99% accuracy using linear regression to predict car prices. |

## Biology Inspired Machine Learning

| Project Link | Algorithm | Tools | Project Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| üß© [Biology Inspired Sudoku Solver](https://github.com/JacobV2001/Artificial-Intelligence-Projects/tree/main/Sudoku_Solver) | Backtracking, Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing | Python, Time Module | This project compares the performance of three biology-inspired algorithms (Backtracking, Hill Climbing, and Simulated Annealing) for solving Sudoku puzzles. The goal is to evaluate their effectiveness and speed in solving different Sudoku puzzles in relation to time and success rate. |

# SQL 


| Project Link | Area of Analysis | Project Description | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| üîç [Does Price Correlate with Quality?](https://github.com/JacobV2001/DS_Books_SQL_Analysis) | Data Analysis, Data Transformation, SQL Queries & Aggregation | This project analyzes the relationship between book prices and their average ratings to see if higher prices correlate with better quality. |
| üìä [Exploring E-commerce Website Analysis with Funnels](https://github.com/JacobV2001/E-Commerse_-SQL_Analysis/tree/main) | Data Analysis, Funnel Analysis, Joins & Grouping, Data Pivoting | This project analyzes user interactions on an e-commerce website, focusing on funnel conversion rates, and examines how device type (desktop üíª vs. mobile üì±) and gender influence user behavior and conversion rates. |
