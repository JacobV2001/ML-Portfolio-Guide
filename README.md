# Machine Learning

## Supervised Learning

| Project Link | Algorithm | Tools | Project Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🎬 [Endgame Image Classifier](https://github.com/JacobV2001/Avengers-EndGame-Image-Classification) | SVM (Support Vector Machine) | OpenCV, scikit-learn, Selenium, Flask, Data Scrapping | A machine learning classifier that identifies Avengers: Endgame characters based on facial features using a Support Vector Machine. The project includes facial feature extraction with OpenCV and a local web interface for user interaction. |
| 🚗 [Car Price Predictor](https://github.com/JacobV2001/Car_Prices_Predictor) | Linear Regression | Pandas, Flask, scikit-learn, Data Preprocessing | A machine learning-powered web application that predicts car prices based on features such as make, model, mileage, and condition. Built with Flask, the app achieves 99% accuracy using linear regression to predict car prices. |
| 🎯 [Breast Cancer Prediction with KNN](https://github.com/JacobV2001/Machine-Learning-Projects/tree/main/Breast%20Cancer%20Classification%20KNN) | K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) | Data Preprocessing, Dimensionality Reduction, Hyperparameter Tuning, Medical Analysis | This project predicts whether a tumor is malignant or benign. With 95% accuracy and 90% recall, the model effectively detects malignant tumors, minimizing false negatives 💻. It utilizes PCA and GridSearchCV to find the optimal performance 📊.|


## Unsupervised Learning

| Project Link | Algorithm | Tools | Project Description |
